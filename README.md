# CSE559A


## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation related to my course project Conformal Prediction for Image Classification as part of CSE 559A Computer Vision, taught by [Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/)

Please have those code files opened on Google Colab. We refactored the code and implemented all experiments entirely on Google Colab.
