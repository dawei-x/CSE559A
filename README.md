# CSE559A


## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation related to my course project Conformal Prediction for Image Classification as part of CSE 559A Computer Vision, taught by [Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/)

Please have those code files opened on Google Colab. We refactored the code and implemented all experiments entirely on Google Colab. 

### For Colab:
[exp_v0.py](./exp_v0.py) merged all needed functions to replicate experiments using Colab. Please note that some components in original implementation/functions have been removed for the sake of concision. Refer to [Exp3.ipynb](./Exp3.ipynb) for a general pipeline and use cases. 
### Prep:
Within your Google Drive's Colab Notebooks directory, create a folder named `cse559a` and upload [exp_v0.py](./exp_v0.py) into that folder. It would be smoother to manually download [imagenet_val](https://image-net.org/data/ILSVRC/2012/ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar) to `cse559a` and rename it as `imagenet_val.tar`.
